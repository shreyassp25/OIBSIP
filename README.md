This Project is completed using application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Logistic regression. 

Algorithm that can be used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Dicision tree classifier 
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
5. metrics
6. train_test_split
<br>
For this project iris dataset from kaggle has been used</br>
